## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `CHANGELOG.md` — this file, tracking changes from the public OSS baseline forward
- `apps/chat-embed/` — CORS-relay proxy for embedding Athena-backed chat on external websites (documented in README and build scripts)
- GitHub issue and pull request templates (`.github/`)

### Changed
- README updated to document Chat Embed interface alongside Jarvis Web and API
- `scripts/build-and-push.sh` includes `athena-chat-embed` in the `ADMIN_SERVICES` build array
- `.env.example` curated: removed stale keys, corrected drift between documented and actual environment variables

### Fixed
- `docs/INSTALLATION.md` — broken cross-references repaired

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-05

> **First public OSS baseline, anchored to commit [`7f5387b`](https://github.com/jstuart0/project-athena-oss/commit/7f5387b).**
> Pre-existing commits represent initial development history leading to this point.
> Entries below describe the state of the project at this baseline, not changes since a prior release.

### Added

- **Jarvis Web** (`apps/jarvis-web/`) — full-featured browser chat interface with streaming text, push-to-talk voice, LiveKit WebRTC streaming, smart home widgets, owner/guest mode, and music playback
- **Chat Embed** (`apps/chat-embed/`) — lightweight CORS-relay proxy so external websites can embed an Athena chatbot; fetches assistant profile from admin backend at startup; includes per-IP rate limiting and analytics source tagging
- **MLX streaming** — real token-level streaming for MLX-format models; `answer_chunk` SSE events relay tokens to the browser as they are generated
- **Analytics Mode** — optional conversation capture and review pipeline; tracks source, mode, latency, and session data; gated behind `MODULE_ANALYTICS=true`
- **Persistent chat sessions** — anonymous browser-cookie session IDs retain conversation context across page reloads
- **Safety guardrails** — jailbreak pre-screen layer in the orchestrator preprocessing stack
- **Semantic cache** — intent-aware response caching to avoid redundant LLM calls for equivalent queries
- **Privacy filter** — PII scrubbing (`src/shared/privacy_filter.py`) for queries routed to cloud LLM backends
- **Complexity-aware model routing** — regex-only complexity detector selects fast 4B vs. capable 14B/32B model tier without a routing LLM call
- **Multi-intent decomposition** — orchestrator decomposes compound queries ("turn on the lights and check the weather") into parallel sub-queries
- **23 RAG microservices** — weather, sports, dining, flights, airports, Amtrak, directions, transportation, streaming, events, SeatGeek, SerpAPI, community events, news, stocks, price comparison, Tesla Fleet API, web search, site scraper, BrightData, media, recipes, one-call weather
- **OpenAI-compatible gateway** — `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint for drop-in compatibility with Home Assistant and any OpenAI client library
- **4-layer anti-hallucination pipeline** — dedicated validation model fact-checks LLM responses against retrieved source data before delivery
- **Admin UI** — web interface for runtime model assignment, feature flags, encrypted API key management, service registry, device management, guest mode, analytics, audit log, and memory management; 62 route modules, 50+ DB migrations
- **Module system** — `MODULE_*` environment variable toggles for Home Assistant integration, guest mode, analytics, and Jarvis Web
- **Read-only viewer role** — restricted admin access tier for non-operator users
- **OSS tuning controls** — diagnostics panel and control-plane UI for observable pipeline tuning

### Changed

- README restructured to present chat interface as a first-class deployment path alongside voice hardware
- Dashboard health checks use environment variables rather than hardcoded addresses
- Orchestrator synthesis token limit raised for chat interface to prevent response cutoff on long list answers
- Chat interface routed to complex model tier for richer responses
- `qwen3` and `llama.cpp` thinking/reasoning tokens suppressed via `/no_think` and equivalent flags to reduce latency

### Fixed

- Conversation context not persisting across multi-turn streamed sessions
- Empty responses from streaming endpoint under certain model backends
- `NameError` / `UnboundLocalError` in analytics and search-log paths when modules were partially enabled
- Debug-logs endpoint returning 503 instead of degrading gracefully
- Jarvis Web streaming not wired to `/api/chat/stream` (frontend connected to non-streaming path)
- `interface_type` not forwarded to streaming endpoint initial state
- LLM hallucinated role-continuation in streaming `finalize_node`
- Base knowledge URL validation and progressive streaming correctness
- ASCII art formatting in README

### Security

- Admin backend hardened: service-to-service auth, CORS policy, cookie flags, and startup validation added
- API permission enforcement scoped by viewer vs. operator role
